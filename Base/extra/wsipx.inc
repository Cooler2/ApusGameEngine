	Windows Sockets include file for IPX/SPX.  This file contains all
	standardized IPX/SPX information.  Include this header file after
	winsock.h.

	To open an IPX socket, call socket() with an address family of
	AF_IPX, a socket type of SOCK_DGRAM, and protocol NSPROTO_IPX.
	Note that the protocol value must be specified, it cannot be 0.
	All IPX packets are sent with the packet type field of the IPX
	header set to 0.

	To open an SPX or SPXII socket, call socket() with an address
	family of AF_IPX, socket type of SOCK_SEQPACKET or SOCK_STREAM,
	and protocol of NSPROTO_SPX or NSPROTO_SPXII.  If SOCK_SEQPACKET
	is specified, then the end of message bit is respected, and
	recv() calls are not completed until a packet is received with
	the end of message bit set.  If SOCK_STREAM is specified, then
	the end of message bit is not respected, and recv() completes
	as soon as any data is received, regardless of the setting of the
	end of message bit.  Send coalescing is never performed, and sends
	smaller than a single packet are always sent with the end of
	message bit set.  Sends larger than a single packet are packetized
	with the end of message bit set on only the last packet of the
	send.
