const
  MIX_CHANNEL_POST = -2;

  {* This is the format of a special effect callback:
   *
   *   myeffect(int chan, void *stream, int len, void *udata);
   *
   * (chan) is the channel number that your effect is affecting. (stream) is
   *  the buffer of data to work upon. (len) is the size of (stream), and
   *  (udata) is a user-defined bit of data, which you pass as the last arg of
   *  Mix_RegisterEffect(), and is passed back unmolested to your callback.
   *  Your effect changes the contents of (stream) based on whatever parameters
   *  are significant, or just leaves it be, if you prefer. You can do whatever
   *  you like to the buffer, though, and it will continue in its changed state
   *  down the mixing pipeline, through any other effect functions, then finally
   *  to be mixed with the rest of the channels and music for the final output
   *  stream.
   *
   * DO NOT EVER call SDL_LockAudio() from your callback function!
   *}
type
  TMix_EffectFunc_t = procedure(chan: Integer; stream: Pointer; len: Integer; udata: Pointer);

  {*
   * This is a callback that signifies that a channel has finished all its
   *  loops and has completed playback. This gets called if the buffer
   *  plays out normally, or if you call Mix_HaltChannel(), implicitly stop
   *  a channel via Mix_AllocateChannels(), or unregister a callback while
   *  it's still playing.
   *
   * DO NOT EVER call SDL_LockAudio() from your callback function!
   *}
type
  TMix_EffectDone_t = procedure(chan: Integer; udata: Pointer);

  {* Register a special effect function. At mixing time, the channel data is
   *  copied into a buffer and passed through each registered effect function.
   *  After it passes through all the functions, it is mixed into the final
   *  output stream. The copy to buffer is performed once, then each effect
   *  function performs on the output of the previous effect. Understand that
   *  this extra copy to a buffer is not performed if there are no effects
   *  registered for a given chunk, which saves CPU cycles, and any given
   *  effect will be extra cycles, too, so it is crucial that your code run
   *  fast. Also note that the data that your function is given is in the
   *  format of the sound device, and not the format you gave to Mix_OpenAudio(),
   *  although they may in reality be the same. This is an unfortunate but
   *  necessary speed concern. Use Mix_QuerySpec() to determine if you can
   *  handle the data before you register your effect, and take appropriate
   *  actions.
   * You may also specify a callback (Mix_EffectDone_t) that is called when
   *  the channel finishes playing. This gives you a more fine-grained control
   *  than Mix_ChannelFinished(), in case you need to free effect-specific
   *  resources, etc. If you don't need this, you can specify NULL.
   * You may set the callbacks before or after calling Mix_PlayChannel().
   * Things like Mix_SetPanning() are just internal special effect functions,
   *  so if you are using that, you've already incurred the overhead of a copy
   *  to a separate buffer, and that these effects will be in the queue with
   *  any functions you've registered. The list of registered effects for a
   *  channel is reset when a chunk finishes playing, so you need to explicitly
   *  set them with each call to Mix_PlayChannel*().
   * You may also register a special effect function that is to be run after
   *  final mixing occurs. The rules for these callbacks are identical to those
   *  in Mix_RegisterEffect, but they are run after all the channels and the
   *  music have been mixed into a single stream, whereas channel-specific
   *  effects run on a given channel before any other mixing occurs. These
   *  global effect callbacks are call "posteffects". Posteffects only have
   *  their Mix_EffectDone_t function called when they are unregistered (since
   *  the main output stream is never "done" in the same sense as a channel).
   *  You must unregister them manually when you've had enough. Your callback
   *  will be told that the channel being mixed is (MIX_CHANNEL_POST) if the
   *  processing is considered a posteffect.
   *
   * After all these effects have finished processing, the callback registered
   *  through Mix_SetPostMix() runs, and then the stream goes to the audio
   *  device.
   *
   * DO NOT EVER call SDL_LockAudio() from your callback function!
   *
   * returns zero if error (no such channel), nonzero if added.
   *  Error messages can be retrieved from Mix_GetError().
